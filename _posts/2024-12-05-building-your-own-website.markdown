Here are some notes from the building a website meeting.

# Personal webpages
Having a research website is important. There are lots of ways to do it.
### On linux space
- write the website in your public.html file and then it will be hosted on something along the lines of users.earth.ox.ac.uk/~user0123/index.html
-	This gives a static page that is hosted in the department

### On a similar system run by the university
-	https://help.it.ox.ac.uk/guide-to-using-personal-web-pages-service
-	These still work if the department doesnâ€™t have power

### github.io
-	this lets you move university and keep your website
####	andreww.github.io
-	at its most simple, you can just write some html
####	compearthsci.github.io
-	Uses a templating language (Jekyll) rather than needing to write raw html
-	Write content in markdown
-	Simple syntax, you can put headings etc.
-	When you commit these documents to github, it builds the website.
-	You can do fancy things with this
-	Jekyll template does the transformation from markdown to html and then adds on the css


# Websites for software projects
### through github
- e.g. greenscheduler.github.io
- Have a github workflow which builds and deploys documentation
- Keep documentation up to date in a folder on github (e.g. quickstart info) and can also pull out documentation from the code (e.g. docstrings)
- e.g. use Sphinx for the documentation
- JOS papers are also written in markdown
### through readthedocs
- e.g. terratools.github.io
- Have documentation in repository in docs folder
- Use readthedocs and grant read access to repository. This rebuilds the docs everytime the repo changes.
- Advantage of readthedocs is that it keeps more versioning.
